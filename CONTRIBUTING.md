# Contribution Guide

## Introduction

This section aims to familiarise developers to the Polkadot Staking Dashboard [[GitHub](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard), [Demo](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-staking-dashboard/#/overview)] for the purpose of contributing to the project.

Reach out to ross@parity.io for clarification of any content within this document.

## Major Packages Used

- React 18
- Polkadot JS API [[docs](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api)]
- React Chart JS 2 for graphing. [[docs](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/), [React docs](https://react-chartjs-2.js.org/)]
- Framer Motion. [[docs](https://www.framer.com/docs/animation/)]
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v5/search) for the majority of icons. [Ionicons](https://ionic.io/ionicons) for side menu footer icons
- SCSS for theme configuration and Styled Components [[docs](https://styled-components.com/docs)] for component styling.

## Environment Variables

Optionally apply the following envrionment variables in an environment file such as `.env` or with `yarn build` to customise the build of staking dashboard:

```
# disable all mentioning of fiat values and token prices
VITE_DISABLE_FIAT=1

# display an organisation label in the network bar
VITE_ORGANISATION="© Parity Technologies"

# provide a privacy policy url in the network bar
VITE_PRIVACY_URL=https://www.parity.io/privacy/
```

## Config Files

There are some ad-hoc files defining app configuration where needed. These just provide a means of bootstrapping app data, and further abstraction could be explored in the future.

- [`config/pages.ts`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/blob/main/src/config/pages.ts): provides the pages and page categories of the app.
- [`config/help.ts`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/blob/main/src/config/help.ts): provides the help content.
- [`Utils.ts`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/blob/main/src/Utils.ts): Various general helper functions used throughout the app, such as formatting utilities.

## Folders

Folders are structured in the [`src/`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/tree/main/src) directory to separate functional, presentational and context components:

- [`contexts`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/tree/main/src/contexts): context providers for the app. All Polkadot JS API interaction happens in these files.
- [`img`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/tree/main/src/img): app SVGs.
- [`library`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/tree/main/src/library): reusable components that could eventually be abstracted into a separate UI library.
- [`modals`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/tree/main/src/modals): the various modal pop-ups used in the app.
- [`pages`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/tree/main/src/pages): similar to modals, page components and components that comprise pages.
- [`theme`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/tree/main/src/theme): the theming configuration of the app.
- [`workers`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/tree/main/src/workers): web workers that crunch process-heavy scripts. Only one exists right now, that iterates `erasStakers` and calculates active nominators and minimum nomination bond.

## App Entry

Going from the top-most component, the component hierarchy is set up as follows:

- [`index.tsx`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/blob/main/src/index.tsx): DOM render, of little interest.
- [`App.tsx`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/blob/main/src/App.tsx): wraps `<App />` in the theme provider context and determines the active network from local storage.
- [`Providers.tsx`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/blob/main/src/Providers.tsx): imports and wraps `<Router />` with all the contexts using a withProviders hook. We also wrap styled component's theme provider context here to make the theme configuration work.
- [`Router.tsx`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/blob/main/src/Router.tsx): contains react router `<Route>`'s, in addition to the major app presentational components. Beyond `<Route>` components, this file is also the entry point for the following components:
  - `<Modal />`: top-level of the modal.
  - `<Help />`: top-level of the help module.
  - `<Headers />`: fixed header of the app containing the stash / controller and accounts toggle buttons.
  - `<NetworkBar />`: fixed network bar at the bottom of the app.
  - `<Notifications />`: smaller context-based popups. Currently used on click-to-copy, or to display extrinsic status (pending, success).

## Development Patterns

Documenting some of the development patterns used:

- We use the **"Wrapper" terminology for styled components** that wrap a functional component.
- **Styles are defined on a per-component basis**, being defined in the same folder as the component markup itself. Where unavoidable (such as global styles, interface layout), styled components should reside in [`src/Wrappers.ts`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/blob/main/src/Wrappers.tsx).
- **Theme values** are configured in [`styles/theme.scss`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/blob/main/src/styles/theme.scss), and can be included in any styled component as custom properties. Graph colors are configurable from [`styles/graphs.ts`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/blob/main/src/styles/graphs.ts).
- **Constants or default values** (such as those waiting for Polkadot API) are defined in [`src/constants.ts`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/blob/main/src/constants.ts).
- Packages with **missing TypeScript definitions** can be declared in [`src/react-app-env.d.ts`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/blob/main/src/react-app-env.d.ts).

## TypeScript Support

The majority of components have types. Type additions are welcome for data that makes sense to type (e.g. data that is unlikely to change as we continue development).

We develop in strict mode, so types are always required for objects. Use any initially to adhere to this requirement.

## Testing Support State

**Tests have not yet been developed.**

Testing could be initialised on a per-component basis, such as isolating library components and testing them within a storybook environment.

Integration tests make sense for the app itself, ensuring the page layout, help module, and modals display the correct content at various app states. These states currently persist of:

- Connecting to the network, fetching from API, fully synced.
- Actively staking, not actively staking.
- Account connected, no account connected.
